# Political Ads
On Oct. 30, 2019, Twitter announced that it will ban political ads, which makes me curious about Google and Facebook's ad policies. Since these two companies all have ad transparency platform, I conducted some analyses on the public data.

## Google Advertisement Analysis
All the recent political ads can be downloaded from [Google Transparency Report](https://transparencyreport.google.com/political-ads/region/US). And I wrote a scraper to detect which ads are taken down by Google using Selenium.

## Facebook Advertisement Analysis
Since I need a confirmation code through mail to use the Facebook Ad Library API, I decided to use the public data to do the analysis. The data are downloaded from [Facebook Ad library Report](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/report/?source=archive-landing-page&country=US) and [Ferderal Election Commission](https://www.fec.gov/data/). I analyzed the ad spending of democratic candidates and President Trump and I also looked into Facebook's disbursement in the recent three elections.
