# Facebook Advertisement Analysis

The data are downloaded from [Facebook Ad library Report](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/report/?source=archive-landing-page&country=US) and [Ferderal Election Commission](https://www.fec.gov/data/). I analyzed the ad spending of democratic candidates and President Trump and I also looked into Facebook's disbursement in the recent three elections.
